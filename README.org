** Description

The TMC2209 is an ultra-silent motor driver IC for two phase stepper motors with
both UART serial and step and direction interfaces.

* Communication

The TMC2209 communicates over a UART serial port using a single wire interface.

The UART single wire interface allows control of the TMC2209 with any set of
microcontroller UART serial TX and RX pins. The single serial signal is
connected to both the TX pin and the RX pin, with a 1k resistor between the TX
pin and the RX pin to separate them.

The microcontroller serial port must be specified during the TMC2209 setup.

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp

#include <Arduino.h>
#include <TMC2209.h>

// Instantiate TMC2209
TMC2209 stepper_driver;

void setup()
{
  stepper_driver.setup(Serial1);
}

#+END_SRC

** Arduino Serial

[[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial][Arduino Serial Web Page]]

On some Arduino boards (e.g. Uno, Nano, Mini, and Mega) pins 0 and 1 are used
for communication with the computer on the serial port named "Serial". Pins 0
and 1 cannot be used on these boards to communicate with the TMC2209. Connecting
anything to these pins can interfere with that communication, including causing
failed uploads to the board.

Arduino boards with additional serial ports, such as "Serial1" and "Serial2",
can use those ports to communicate with the TMC2209.

** Teeny Serial

[[https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_uart.html][Teensy Serial Web Page]]

The Teensy boards have 1 to 8 hardware serial ports (Serial1 - Serial8), which
may be used to connect to serial devices.

Unlike Arduino boards, the Teensy USB serial interface is not connected to pins
0 and 1, allowing pins 0 and 1 to be used to communicate with a TMC2209 using
"Serial1".

** Serial Addresses

More than one TMC2209 may be connected to a single serial port, if each TMC2209
is assigned a unique serial address. The default serial address is
"SERIAL_ADDRESS_0". The serial address may be changed from "SERIAL_ADDRESS_0"
using the TMC2209 hardware input pins MS1 and MS2, to "SERIAL_ADDRESS_1",
"SERIAL_ADDRESS_2", or "SERIAL_ADDRESS_3".

The TMC2209 serial address must be specified during the TMC2209 setup, if it is
not equal to the default of "SERIAL_ADDRESS_0".

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp

#include <Arduino.h>
#include <TMC2209.h>

// Instantiate TMC2209
TMC2209 stepper_driver;

void setup()
{
  stepper_driver.setup(Serial1,TMC2209::SERIAL_ADDRESS_1);
}
