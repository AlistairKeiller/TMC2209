** Description

The TMC2209 is an ultra-silent motor driver IC for two phase stepper motors with
both UART serial and step and direction interfaces.

* Communication

The TMC2209 communicates over a UART serial port using a single wire interface.

The UART single wire interface allows control of the TMC2209 with any set of
microcontroller UART serial TX and RX pins. The single serial signal is
connected to both the TX pin and the RX pin, with a 1k resistor between the TX
pin and the RX pin to separate them.

** Arduino Serial

[[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial][Arduino Serial Web Page]]

Some Arduino boards (e.g. Uno, Nano, and Mini) have only one serial port (named
"Serial") that is used for communication with the host computer. Connecting
anything to these pins can interfere with that communication, including causing
failed uploads to the board.

Arduino boards with additional serial ports, such as "Serial1" and "Serial2",
can use those ports to communicate with the TMC2209.
